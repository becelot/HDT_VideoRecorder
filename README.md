# Hearthstone Video Recorder

A plugin for Hearthstone Deck Tracker that automatically starts recording if a new game is started and cuts off after the game has finished. It provides tools to automatically save the last game on disk or delete the footage. This provides a useful replay functionality for Hearthstone.

# Note

This plugin requires OBS to be installed on your PC for recording game footage.

# Warning

This is a work in progress plugin and nowhere near finished.

# Future Work

In the future, other alternative video recording software will be added for compatibility.
